Here's a detailed README file for your GitHub repository, including the steps and tasks you've completed so far:

# **End to End ML Projects** Industry Standard

## User Requirements to Create Projects

To successfully run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages Knowledge:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Exception handling
- logging
- sys

## Steps to Set Up and Develop the Project

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment isolates your project dependencies, making it easier to manage and avoid conflicts.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Step 2: Set Up Git Repository
Initialize a Git repository for version control and collaboration.

```bash
git init
```

Create a `README.md` file for project documentation.

Configure your Git user information:

```bash
git config user.email "gujurialekha@gmail.com"
git config user.name "Alekha"
```

Make your first commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/alekha1234/Complete-ML-Project.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Create Setup and Requirements Files
Create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the dependencies for your project. This allows others to easily install the necessary packages.

Example `requirements.txt`:

```txt
numpy
pandas
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

Create a `setup.py` file to build and distribute your Python package.

Example `setup.py`:

[https://github.com/alekha1234/Complete-ML-Project/blob/main/setup.py](setup.py)

Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Create Source Folder and Build Package
Create a `Source` folder to hold your projectâ€™s code. Include an `__init__.py` file to make it a Python package.

```bash
mkdir Source
touch Source/__init__.py
```

### Step 5: Set Up Logging
Set up logging to keep track of your application's runtime events. This helps in debugging and understanding the flow of the application.

`Logger file `: [https://github.com/alekha1234/Complete-ML-Project/blob/main/logger.py](logger.py)


### Step 6: Create Custom Exception Handling
Implement custom exception handling to manage errors gracefully and log them appropriately.
